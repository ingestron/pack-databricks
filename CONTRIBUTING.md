Code here should make sense to someone who has never seen it: simple code,
and documentation good enough to use it without reading the source. The rules
below make that checkable.

## Code

- **One direction of flow.** A package is a short pipeline of steps, one
  module per step. Each step takes plain data and returns plain data plus
  diagnostics. No step reaches back into an earlier one. Recursion inside one
  step is fine, for example resolving a file that includes another.
- **Small units.** At most 200 lines per file, 40 lines per function, nesting
  at most 3 deep, complexity at most 10. ESLint enforces these; an exception
  needs a comment explaining why.
- **I/O at the edges.** Core logic does not import `node:fs`; it reads through
  a small interface, so it runs in Node, browsers and tests alike.
- **Functions and plain objects first.** A class only for real state with a
  lifetime, such as a project held open. No inheritance, and no class of only
  static methods.
- **Few dependencies.** A pull request that adds a runtime dependency says
  why it is needed.

### Modules

- `src/index.ts` is the package's only public surface (the extension's is
  `src/extension.ts`). It groups its exports by module, one comment line per
  group.
- Each step or feature is a module: a folder under `src/`, one level deep,
  named for what it does (`plan`, `scaffold`, `fold`). Not `utils`,
  `helpers`, `common` or `misc`; not `build` or `dist`, which Git ignores; not
  the name of another Ingestron repository.
- A module's `index.ts` lists what the rest of the package may use. Files in
  one module import each other directly; another module's files are reached
  only through its `index.ts`. Modules never import each other in a cycle.
- `src/folders.ts` holds every path found from the file's own location, such
  as the data folders a package ships. It stays at the top of `src/`, so the
  same relative path works compiled and bundled.
- Tests mirror the source: `test/<module>/<name>.test.ts`. Tests that run the
  whole command or package stay at the top of `test/`.
- `node scripts/check-modules.mjs` checks these rules, and `pnpm validate`
  runs it.

### Shapes and the public API

| Shape          | For                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Interface      | A contract something implements or receives (`Pack`, `FileSource`) |
| Type alias     | Data, unions and function types                                    |
| Function       | A transformation: plain data in, plain data and diagnostics out    |
| Class          | State with a lifetime, as above                                    |
| Typed constant | A fixed table (`codeHelp`)                                         |

Every export from `src/index.ts` has a doc comment and one release tag:
`@public`, `@beta` (may change in a minor release) or `@internal` (for other
Ingestron packages only). An export kept for compatibility is also
`@deprecated`, naming its replacement and the major version that removes it.
ESLint fails on a missing doc comment and API Extractor on a missing tag.
Names say what a function returns or does; types are nouns.

Writing style:

| Do                                                     | Avoid                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| One check per rule, each with its own message and code | `check(a && b && c, "X", "Invalid")`     |
| Descriptive names                                      | `v`, `k`, `out`, `tmp`                   |
| One declaration per statement                          | `const a = 1, b = 2;`                    |
| Visible rules, documented once                         | Behaviour that depends on a field's name |
| Limits in one documented options object with defaults  | Magic numbers at call sites              |
| Shared guards written once (`isSafeKey`)               | The same check copied into several files |
| Comments that explain why                              | Comments that repeat what the code says  |

Packages meet only at their entry points: ESLint refuses an import of another
package's files or a relative import that leaves the package.

## Documentation

User documentation lives in the documentation site,
[ingestron/docs](https://github.com/ingestron/docs); change it there in the same
release as the code. Package READMEs say what the package is, how to install
it and how to develop it. Every `ts` code block in a README must be a complete
file; `pnpm validate` type-checks them all.

## Tests

- Every change in behaviour comes with a test that fails without it.
- Test names read as sentences describing behaviour.

## Done means

1. `pnpm validate` passes.
2. A public API change updates the API report (`pnpm api` writes `api/`), so
   reviewers see the interface change.
3. A change users see updates the documentation site,
   [ingestron/docs](https://github.com/ingestron/docs), in the same release.

`origin/main`; pull requests run it too.
